# SimpleACDLogger
This is a simple perl script for logging the ACD activity of a Mitel PBX to a daily datestamped text file.
I have included a compiled version of the perl script as well that should be able to run without the need to install perl.
You may however need to add some libraries to the directory, depending on what version of Windows you have installed.

To use just update the config.ini file with the IP address of your PBX and then run the acd.exe file.
